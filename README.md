# Project Overview

This project focuses on data preparation and clustering analysis to predict customer churn. The work is divided into distinct phases, each aimed at ensuring data is ready for effective modeling.

## Folder Structure

The repository is organized into the following folders:

- Data_Preparation: Contains all deliverables related to data preparation.
- Clustering_Analysis: Includes all deliverables associated with clustering analysis.
- Datasets: Stores the original and processed datasets used in the project.

## Deliverables

### 1. Data Preparation

In the Data_Preparation folder, you will find:

- Scaling Techniques Documentation: A document explaining the scaling techniques applied, including relevant code snippets.
- Training and Testing Dataset Documentation: A document explaining the size and composition of training and testing datasets.

### 2. Clustering Analysis

In the Clustering_Analysis folder, you will find:

- *Optimal Number of Clusters*: Documentation and visualizations illustrating the optimal number of clusters identified using the elbow method.
- *Trained K-Means Model*: The trained K-Means clustering model file, along with the code used for training.
- *Cluster Visualization and Labeling*: Visualizations of the resulting clusters, complete with labels and interpretations.

### 3. Datasets

In the Datasets folder, you will find:

- Original Datasets: Raw data files used for analysis.
- Training and Testing Sets: Separate files for training and testing datasets.
